        <p>
          I love programming and finding innovative solutions to problems.
          Ruby is at the moment my favorite programming language and Ruby on Rails my favorite web framework but am open to code in other languages or frameworks too.
          My goal is to code and explore the world.

        <p>
          Between 2016 - 2021, I worked as the Deputy Director and an Educator.
          My job was to manage various projects, involving teachers and students in finding the right methodology and strategies to teach and learn.
          I worked with schools and universities across the world to facilitate language learning as well as using digital means to teach and to learn.
